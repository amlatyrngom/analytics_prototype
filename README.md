# Smart IDs
Repo for Smart IDs. Most of the code is in `src/` directory. The names of the subdirectories are self-explanatory (`optimizer/` contains the optimizer code, `execution` is the execution engine). `src/main.cpp` contains experiments.

This is a standard `cmake` project, so you need cmake to build it. See `lib.sh` for more info.
